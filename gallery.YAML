  Our project is an game similar to Battleship. 
  We have a 2-player game where both players try to drop birds into
  hidden holes throughout a game board (10 x 10 grid) 
  There are 5 different types of birds
  given to each player, each with different values. If you drop the 
  bird in a box you'll recieve the amount of points the bird is worth.
  The game ends when one of the players discovers all of the opponent's holes. 
  Whichever player ends the game with the most points wins. 

  Our game is supported by graphics.
